    "Rand Index and Jaccard are external cluster validation measures to asses cluster quality. They use a series of decisions to produce a measure a number between 0 and 1 (higher values are better). Each pair of points is considered and a decision is made for each pair. Since we consider pairs of points, for a dataset with n points, the **total number of decisions is (n(n-1))/2.** Example: If there are 3 points x1, x2, x3, then the possible combinations are [x1, x2], [x1, x3], [x2, x3], which is (3(3-1))/2 = 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "The decisions are:\n",
    "1. Does this pair belong in the same cluster (same class labels)?\n",
    "2. Does this pair belong in separate clusters (different class labels)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Class labels = {A: x1, x2, B: x3, x4}\n",
    "\n",
    "Cluster assignments = {X1: x1, x2, x3 X2: x4}\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the Rand Index for the above clustering result, we take each pair and check if the clustering decision is correct."
